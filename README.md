## Abstract
This repository contains code and additional resources supporting our study.

## 1. Data
The datasets used in this study are publicly accessible at:
- [Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)](https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/index.html)
- [the Interactive Atlas of Heart Disease and Stroke at the CDC (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/dhdsp/maps/atlas/index.htm)

## 2. Code Structure
### Overview
Our study introduces a novel clustering algorithm to analyze longitudinal associations between SDOH and stroke mortality across US counties.

### Reproducibility
- The folder **`grpreg2`**: Contains code for algorithmic optimization.
- The folder **`simu`**: Contains code for simulation experiments.
- The folder **`realdata`**: Contains code for analyzing the real data.
